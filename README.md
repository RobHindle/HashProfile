# HashProfile
Tools to prepare Hash profiles on files to support WhiteListing

Welcome to ReadMe.txt ReadMeHP.txt for Certificate tools.

Disclaimer:  Use this tool at your own choosing and risk.

HashProfile.txt is provided if your organization is uncomfortable with transfering in .ps1 files.

Hash Profile tool provides for crude anti-tampering considerations:
      Have files the same Hash profiles from source to target?

You will see a HashProfile<Date-Time>.txt that has Hash value confirmations of the untampered file in this project.
	Independantly you will see this same file published at https://web.ncf.ca/bv178/HashChecks.html
Hash Confirmations only provide comfort to mitigate tampering.
